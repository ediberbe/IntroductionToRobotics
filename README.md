# Introduction to Robotics (2021 - 2022)
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.
  
## Homework 1 ✔️

**Components**: RBG led (1 minimum), potentiometers (3 minimum), resistors and wires (per logic)  

**Technical Task**: Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the
color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done
with digital electronics (aka you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected
to the led.

## Homework 2 ✔️

**Components**: 5 LEDs, 1 button, 1 buzzer, resistors and wires (per logic)

**General  description**: Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk. You will use 2 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for people (red and green)and 3 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for cars (red, yellow and green). See the states it needs to go through. If anything is not clear, ask. Also,see the uploaded video (the intervals are different, but the states flow isthe same). It’s a traffic lights system for people and cars - don’t overthink it.

## Homework 3 ✔️

**Components**: a buzzer and a 7-segment display (or a led bar / or 8 leds in a row that simulate a led bar)

**Task**: should detect EMF (check body and near outlets.  DO NOT IN-SERT INTO OUTLET). It should print the value on the 7-segment display (or light the led bar) and should make a sound based on the intensity.
